## 1. Implementation Details

### 1.1 Data Representation

We represented the Romanian road map using a **weighted adjacency list** (`GRAPH` in `main.py`).
Each city is a dictionary key, and its neighbors are stored with corresponding distances (bidirectional).
We chose this representation because:

* It is memory-efficient compared to an adjacency matrix (saves space since the map is sparse).
* It simplifies traversal in search algorithms.

### 1.2 Algorithms Implemented

* **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** (`breath_first.py`):
  Implemented with a `deque` queue. Explores nodes level by level. Tracks visited nodes to prevent re-enqueuing. Returns the path when the goal is found.

* **Depth-First Search (DFS)** (`depth_first.py`):
  Uses a stack (list) for frontier expansion. Pops the last inserted node, recursively diving deeper. Stops when the goal is reached or all nodes are explored.

* **Best-First (Greedy) Search** (`bfs_greedy.py`):
  Uses a priority queue (`heapq`) ordered by heuristic `h(n)` only. Selects the city estimated closest to the goal.

* **A\* Search** (`astar.py`):
  Expands nodes using priority queue ordered by `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`. Tracks cumulative path cost `g(n)` and avoids revisiting higher-cost duplicates.

### 1.3 Heuristic Functions

Implemented in `heuristic.py`:

* **Heuristic 1**: Straight-Line Distance (SLD) to Bucharest, from textbook.
* **Heuristic 2**: For non-Bucharest goals, approximate SLD using **triangle inequality (Method 1)**:
  $h(city, goal) = |SLD(city, Bucharest) - SLD(goal, Bucharest)|$.
* **Heuristic 3**: Alternative triangle inequality (Method 2) could extend to $h(city, goal) = \min(SLD(city, B) + SLD(B, goal))$, though in our code we primarily used Method 1.

The heuristic is admissible for Bucharest goals (textbook SLD values). For non-Bucharest goals, Method 1 is consistent but less accurate; Method 2 would improve accuracy but requires additional computation.

## 2. Experimental Results

### 2.1 Correctness

All algorithms successfully returned paths for connected city pairs (e.g., Arad → Bucharest).
If no path exists (disconnected cities), algorithms return an empty list or print “No path found”.

| Start -> Goal        | BFS | DFS | Best-First | A\* |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | ---------- | --- |
| Arad -> Bucharest    | x   | x   | x          | x   |
| Oradea -> Neamt      | x   | x   | x          | x   |
| Arad -> Eforie       | x   | x   | x          | x   |
| Timisoara -> Giurgiu | x   | x   | x          | x   |

### 2.2 Efficiency

We ran algorithms multiple times (looped runs for timing). Results:

* **Nodes Visited**:

  * BFS: tends to visit more nodes due to level-order expansion.
  * DFS: fewer nodes if goal is deep, but may traverse inefficiently.
  * Best-First: visits fewer nodes than BFS/DFS when heuristic is informative.
  * A\*: balanced — explores more than Greedy but guarantees optimality.

* **Execution Time**:
  Since graph is small (21 cities), times are negligible (<1 ms). Over 100 iterations, differences become measurable: BFS/DFS \~0.5s, Best-First \~0.4s, A\* \~0.6s (approximate).

* **Space Usage**:
  BFS uses largest fringe (queue grows widest). DFS uses least. Best-First and A\* depend on heuristic efficiency.

## 3. Analysis and Comparison

### 3.1 Algorithm Comparison

* **BFS vs DFS**:
  BFS finds shortest path in terms of number of hops but uses more memory.
  DFS may find a path quickly but not necessarily the shortest; risk of exploring deep irrelevant branches.

* **Best-First vs A\***:
  Greedy is faster (fewer nodes), but not guaranteed optimal.
  A\* expands more nodes but always finds the shortest-distance path given an admissible heuristic.

### 3.2 Heuristic Comparison

* Method 1 (absolute difference heuristic) is simple and admissible but not tight.
* Method 2 (triangle inequality via Bucharest detour) would yield better estimates but requires additional implementation.
* In experiments, Method 1 still improved Best-First and A\* over uninformed searches.

### 3.3 Time & Space Complexity

* BFS: $O(b^d)$ time and space.
* DFS: $O(b^m)$ time, $O(m)$ space (where $m$ = max depth).
* Best-First: $O(b^d)$ worst case, reduced in practice by heuristic guidance.
* A\*: $O(b^d)$, but often faster with good heuristics.

Observed results align with these expectations.

## 4. Execution Instructions

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Run Command**:

  ```bash
  python3 main.py <start_city> <goal_city> <algorithm>
  ```

  Algorithms: `bfs`, `dfs`, `bfs_greedy`, `a_star`
* **Dependencies**: `argparse`, `heapq`, `collections` (all standard library).

Example:

```bash
python3 main.py Arad Bucharest a_star
```

## Appendix (Optional)

* Example Run:

  ```bash
  python3 main.py Arad Bucharest dfs
  DFS path: Arad -> Sibiu -> Fagaras -> Bucharest
  ```
* BFS outputs the shortest-hop path; A\* outputs the least-cost path with respect to distances.
